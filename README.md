# Extract cxserver configuration and export to CSV

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive tool for extracting language pairs supported by the cxserver service and exporting them to a CSV file. The extraction process involves parsing YAML files within the "config/" directory of the cxserver repository. The primary aim is to create an in-memory structure with information on supported language pairs and export this data into a CSV file.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Execute main.py to extract information from the YAML files and generate the CSV files.
3. To run tests, execute test.py after deleting "mt-defaults.csv" and "supported_pairs.csv" to ensure accurate testing.

## Project Structure:
* config/: Contains YAML files with configuration information.
* test/: Directory for testing purposes.
* main.py: Main Python script for parsing YAML files, extracting information, and exporting to CSV.
* test.py: Python script for testing the functionality of main.py.
* supported_pairs.csv: Output CSV file containing information on supported language pairs.
* mt-defaults.csv: Output CSV file containing information from the "mt-defaults.wikimedia.yaml" file.
* LICENSE.md: MIT License file.
* README.md: Project documentation.

## Libraries Utilised
1. PyYAML: Used for parsing YAML files.
2. CSV: Python's built-in library for handling CSV operations.

<h2>Integrated the functioning of mt-defaults.wikimedia.yaml</h2>
In the most recent commit I have integrated the functioning of "mt-default.wikimedia.yaml". This file contains the information about the preferred engines for a specific Source Langauge and Target Language pair. To use this file I first converted it into a CSV file named "mt-defaults.csv" with columns named "source language", "target language" and "preferred engine". Then using the "final_updated.py" I compared "mt-defaults.csv" and "supported_pairs.csv" and for the rows in which the value of source language, target language and the preferred engine (in mt-defaults.csv) & translation engine (in supported_pairs.csv) were same, I updated the value of "is preferred engine" to true which was otherwise set to False by default.
<h2>Usage Instruction</h2>
1. First clone the repository.<br>
2. Execute the "main.py".<br>
3. Run the test from test directory by executing "test.py".<br>
<h2>Test Instruction</h2>
Make sure that the main.py file that you wish to test is there in the test directory. In order to avoid any confusions you can delete the "mt-defaults.csv" and "supported_pairs.csv" since these two files are generated during the test by the execution of "main.py".<br>
The "test.py" runs the "main.py" for the test environment created in the test directory for which the expected output is already saved in "expected__supported_pairs.csv" and "expected_mt-defaults.csv". Then the files generated by "main.py" are compared with the expected files and if the outputs match the file will pass the test.
